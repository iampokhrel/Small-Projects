# Small Projects

This repository contains various small projects, created using basic Python logic and Python GUI packages like Tkinter. These are as described below:

1. **Pomodoro Timer App**: This app allows for concentrated work on a particular task. This allows for work for 25 minutes, then a break of 5 minutes. This continues till 4 such work slots, after which a longer break is taken for 15 minutes.
2. **To-Do list**
  i. _Simple one_: This allows for simple note for a to-do list. It has options for adding a task, marking a task complete, and delete task, with an option to view the number of total and completed tasks.
3. **Rent Calculator**: This program runs in the terminal and is a very basic app allowing a person to calculate rent per person based on house rent, food consumed, and electricity used.
